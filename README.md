4. In your notepad / VSC in the line 40 add your discord webhook
5. Now if you are using notepad you need to download python from https://www.python.org/ to make it work it wont take so much time, Then save it as whateverthenameyouwant.py and then run it by double click on the file you saved it in.
6. Make sure discord is already opened so you can see the embeded message in the server that you have the webhook stored inside.
